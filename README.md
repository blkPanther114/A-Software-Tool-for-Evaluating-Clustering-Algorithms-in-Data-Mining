For the final year’s individual project in my undergraduate studies of Computing, the topic I chose to do was: ‘A Software Tool for Evaluating Clustering Algorithms in Data Mining’, which involved a heavy amount of background studies in data mining and machine learning. To give me more challenges, I have been self-teaching the C# language and implemented four different types of clustering algorithms. I’ve successfully created a software that allows users to upload different data files, then choose different clustering algorithms and similarity functions to evaluate their performance. My software presented some advantages compared to the existing tool Weka, such as quality measurements and better result displaying. 


The ppt file(A software tool for evaluating clustering algorithms in (5).pptx provides a brief overview on:

1.the background of clustering
2.comparison of different clustering algorithms
3.what functions my software provides with test cases
4.advantages my software has comparing to existing tools such as Weka
5.evaluating the perfomances of different algorithms
6.conlcusion
7.limitations, what future works could be done
